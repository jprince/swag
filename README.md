### Install Dependencies
We use [node package manager][npm] (npm) to install dependencies.

Check that you have npm installed by running `npm -v`. If you don't have npm
installed run following:

``` sh
$ brew install npm            # Mac OS X
$ sudo apt-get install npm    # Linux
```

Once npm is installed, use it to install the application dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Compile and Transpile Code
This application uses the ES6 version of Javascript. Since many of its features are not yet
supported by modern browsers, we need to compile it down to ES5. To do this we use [Babel][babel].

Babel's compilation currently runs in the npm build task:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

By default, this task is configured to watch for changes to the files, so you shouldn't need to
rerun it in development.

This application also uses the CommonJS format for requiring modules. Like ES6, this functionality
isn't yet supported in all modern browsers. To support this behavior, we're using
[Webpack][webpack], which transpiles the code down to a single `bundle.js` file.

Webpack's transpilation currently runs in the npm bundle task:

```sh
$ npm run bundle
```

Like the build task, this task is configured to watch for changes to files.

The bundle runs off of the compiled ES5 code (generated by the build), so make sure to run the
build task prior to running bundle.

### Run the Application

You can start the server by running npm start:

```sh
$ npm start
```

This should launch the application at `http://localhost:3001/`.
